								I am a highly motivated developer with experience in a wide range of technologies. I am
								currently pursuing a master's degree after working for a few years as a full-stack
								developer by a wide range of companies. Such as banks, medical companies and government
								institutions. I love what I do which can be seen in my open source contributions and the
								many side projects I have been working on in the past years. I like to explore the
								newest technologies within the field and I am always looking for new ways to improve my
								workflow or new programming languages which can improve my skillset.

								I am currently looking to work remotely through my company VonkProgramming based in the
								Netherlands. Since I am currently studying my hours are very flexible and I am able to
								work on a wide range of projects. I don't fear diving into new tech stacks.

									The role at 'ING', in Amsterdam, North Holland, Netherlands, began in April 2022 and

									In addition to these duties, for a certain period, the role also encompassed serving

									At 'SVB', based in Amstelveen, North Holland, Netherlands, the role took place from
									April 2021 to April 2022. The primary responsibility involved programming in
									JavaScript, utilizing the Angular framework. An important part of the job was
									managing a significant transition, migrating an existing system from AngularJS to
									Angular. This migration required deep understanding of both frameworks, and
									extensive planning to ensure a seamless transition with minimal disruption. In
									addition to development work, the role also entailed working on pipelines, which
									required careful oversight and management to ensure a smooth, efficient workflow and
									continuous delivery.
