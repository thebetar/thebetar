# Default machine installation

In this project also the tools that I use can be found. The tools I use on my normal machine are:

-   tmux
-   vim
-   fzf
-   zsh
-   oh-my-zsh
-   neovim (for non-server environments)
-   VSCode (for non-server environments)

I have also created some custom scripts I use which can be found in `/dotfiles/usr/local`
